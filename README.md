# [Hide Now Playing View](./Hide%20Now%20Playing%20View.css)
As the name suggests, this removes the new right sidebar that displays the currently playing track. This automatically opens everytime you start playing a new playlist/album and song. This simple hides that that sidebar and the button to open it.
